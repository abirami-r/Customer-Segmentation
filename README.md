# Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning

The retailer has tasked us with developing data-driven customer segments, also known as "customer clusters."

Using the provided transaction-level purchase dataset, we aim to build a clustering model that captures both aggregate sales trends and specific item purchases. This project leverages Unsupervised Learning techniques.

The Jupyter Notebook includes the full workflow, from initial data analysis to clustering implementation using the K-means algorithm.
